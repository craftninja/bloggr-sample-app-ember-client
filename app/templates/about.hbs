<div class='about'>
  <p>I am learning about Ember. It is pretty exciting.</p>
  <p>This project was created along with the video at <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">Emberjs.com/guides</a>. It also required links to some css and javascript things that can be found at <a href="http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#legacy_tab">Bootstrap CDN</a> (legacy, version 2.3.2 no icons) and <a href="https://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs</a> (look for showdown and moment).</p>
